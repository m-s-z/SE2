TO DO
Fix the last merge on master(there may be a problem in the Game message that crashes everything) :
Write an integration test starting gm, cs and players on a small board
(we will use this test later to check if something went wrong after refactoring) :

Move handling of messages(that is inside message classes) to GameMaster, write tests for it :
Break down Player logic into smaller functions and write tests for it :
Bother other teams about integration (just creating and joining game for now, no logic)
