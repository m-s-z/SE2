this is just a reminder how to set up the arguments 

right click on (game master or player) select properties. go to debug section and there is a textbox for entry arguments.
The arguments are taken as string and are separated with space so our set up first enter the programs name 
(this is the set up which should work from the console so the first argument will be the name) then the ip address and port.


Console commands with parameters:

Comunication Server:
17-EN-04-cs --port 8000 --conf "../../CommunicationServerSettingsTest"

Game Master:
17-EN-04-cs --address 192.168.0.14 --port 8000 --conf "../../GameMasterSettingsTest.xml"

Player:
17-EN-04-cs --address 192.168.0.14 --port 8000 --conf "../../PlayerSettingsTest.xml" --game "Initial test game" --team "red" --role "member"
