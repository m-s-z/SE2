As for today keep alive message works as:

We send the designated message from the client to server.

Server check the arbitrarly set message length (which coincides only with the keep alive message -> char.toString((char)23) which is equal to 6 characters.

if the message is within the set length we treat it as if it was the keepalive message.
what means. Each time we receive the such message we reset the _timer which if not reset after 5 seconds will disconnect the receiver, therfore the client which didn't send the keepalive message back.

As for now we have this implemented only on communication server
we intend to update Client and GameMaster in near future (most likely before deadline <3)

Please let us know about your thoughts.
